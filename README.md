NOTE: This project requires the cli tool 'angular-cli'. If you don't yet have this, use the following npm command.

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

and install the necessary dependencies using:

```
npm install
```

or, if you prefer using Yarn:

```
yarn install
```

Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
